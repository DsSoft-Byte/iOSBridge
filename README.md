Next-Generation iCu Unlocker follow-up. Proudly presenting, iOSBridge (10).

iOSBridge 11.01.2025 Functionality Notice:

Bypass Server is finally up, iOS 16/17 Bypasses and MDM Unlocks are on the way! Bypassing will now require a 10 Euro one-time fee via PayPal. The activation/purchase site is under construction. When you DM me your Machine ID you get a free lifetime license!

URGENT SECURITY PATCH 10.0.0.7 (10/11/2023)

**Important Note:** All of you should use [this](https://github.com/DsSoft-Byte/iOSBridge/releases/download/v10.0.7-1/iCu.X.Installer.exe) installer, if you wish to try the beta grab the newest iCu X.exe artifact and overwrite the existing iCu X.exe file.

**Important Note regarding the restore feature:** Restore only works on 64 Bit devices on iOS 10.X.X whyever. Please DO NOT use for now. This is a libimobiledevice Windows issue that is ignored by the devs. Nothing i can do to fix it.
