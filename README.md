Next-Generation iCu Unlocker follow-up. Proudly presenting, iOSBridge (10).

URGENT SECURITY PATCH 10.0.0.7 (10.11.2023)

**Important Note:** My free us.to domain expired, and the update server is now at [dssoft.ch/ver.txt](https://dssoft.ch/ver.txt). The new update needs to be downloaded manually from releases.
